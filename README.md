Explanation:

Recommended versions - Our native server version is 1.16.5, meaning that in 1.16.5 and above every block used in our maps will be found. In this way there is no automatic block replacement at all..

Less recommended versions - In these versions there could be some block replacement, but most of the blocks will be available. Security also increases in these versions.

Not recommended versions - There will be lot's of block replacement in these versions. Security is also poorer here.

Unsupported versions - You can not join with these versions at all!

Automatic block replacement - In older versions, when one block is not available the game will replace that block in a way that is only visible to the older client. The experience for people with "Recommended versions" will be completely unchanged. This way is good because no one would have to see the ugly unknown texture block.

We can change this at any time!
